1. <span class="header_2" id="1">Uptime</span>
    1. <span class="header_3" id="1.1">Target Uptime.</span>  If there is a <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available for at least the <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span> as calculated each calendar month.
    2. <span class="header_3" id="1.2">Calculating Uptime.</span>  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> agree to calculate availability of the Cloud Service as the total number of Available Minutes minus the number of Downtime Minutes, divided by the total number of Available Minutes, measured in a calendar month. If the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> includes a partial month, the numerator and denominator will only include the days that are part of the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> for that month.
