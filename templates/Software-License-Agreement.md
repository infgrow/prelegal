    1. <span class="header_3" id="1.1">License.</span>  During the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> and subject to the terms of this Agreement, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> grants <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 10.6 (Assignment)) license to install and use the Software on systems owned or controlled by <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> for the <span class="orderform_link">Permitted Uses</span>. If a <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Affiliate enters a separate Order Form with <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>, the <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> Affiliate creates a separate agreement between <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and that Affiliate, where <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> responsibility to the Affiliate is individual and separate from <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is not responsible for its Affiliates' agreement.
